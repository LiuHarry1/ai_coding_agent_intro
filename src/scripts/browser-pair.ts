/**
 * Check that this machine can hand the browser to an agent.
 *
 * There is no pairing step to perform any more: the relay endpoint is a live
 * capability owned by whichever agent process is asking, so it cannot be set
 * up ahead of time from here. What this does is run the same exchange in its
 * own process — start a relay, open the consent tab, wait for the extension —
 * which is what you want when the real thing failed and you need to know
 * whether the extension is installed, has the right id, and can connect.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx src/scripts/browser-pair.ts
