Examples of when to use multiple agents:
- The task touches multiple parts of the codebase
- It's a large refactor or architectural change
- There are many edge cases to consider
- You'd benefit from exploring different approaches

Example perspectives by task type:
- New feature: simplicity vs performance vs maintainability
- Bug fix: root cause vs workaround vs prevention
- Refactoring: minimal change vs clean architecture
