/**
 * AskUserQuestion tool — multiple-choice prompts to the user.
 *
 * Schema:
 *   - `questions: [...]` 1-4 entries.
 *   - Each question: `{ question, header (<=12 char chip), options,
 *     multiSelect }`. Options: 2-4 per question, each
 *     `{ label, description, preview? }`.
 *   - Uniqueness: question texts unique across the batch; option labels
 *     unique within a single question.
 *
 * Flow: emit `ask_user_question` on the per-request EventBus + register a
 * Promise on `question-broker`. The frontend renders the questions, the
 * user picks options, and the client POSTs to
 * `/ask_user_question/answer`, which resolves the promise. A 5-minute
 * timeout keeps headless deploys from hanging forever.

const DESCRIPTION =
  "Asks the user multiple choice questions to gather information, clarify ambiguity, understand preferences, make decisions or offer them choices.";

const ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_PROMPT = `Use this tool when you need to ask the user questions during execution. This allows you to:
1. Gather user preferences or requirements
2. Clarify ambiguous instructions
3. Get decisions on implementation choices as you work
4. Offer choices to the user about what direction to take.

Usage notes:
- Users will always be able to select "Other" to provide custom text input
- Use multiSelect: true to allow multiple answers to be selected for a question
- If you recommend a specific option, make that the first option in the list and add "(Recommended)" at the end of the label

Plan mode note: In plan mode, use this tool to clarify requirements or choose between approaches BEFORE finalizing your plan. Do NOT use this tool to ask "Is my plan ready?" or "Should I proceed?" - use ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME} for plan approval. IMPORTANT: Do not reference "the plan" in your questions (e.g., "Do you have feedback about the plan?", "Does the plan look good?") because the user cannot see the plan in the UI until you call ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME}. If you need plan approval, use ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME} instead.
